# Inaugural project

In this project we model the time use of couples. We model how work hours of males and females in the home change across differenct parameters.  We also plot how the log relationship of male and female work hours at home vs. the log of the relationship between wages of males and females.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).

How we solve the model can be found in the HouseholdSpecializationModel.py file. 

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
