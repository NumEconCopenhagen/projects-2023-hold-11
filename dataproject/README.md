# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Exploring Swedish macroeconomic data** and is about some key Swedish macroeconoic variables from 1990(q1) and 2020(q1) we attempt to recreate some macroecomic prediction on how some variables are supposed to behave like the interaction between the inflation rate and the unemployment rate, i.e. the Phillips curve.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following dataset**:

1. Bachelor-data.xlsx (*OECD*) 


**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
