This repository contains  
1. Inaugural project. 
2. Data project. We fetch data from **OECD** on **Swedish macro data** and show that the Phillips-curve does not hold empirically for Swedish data.   
3. Model project. We model a Stackelberg duopoly with linear and non-linear marginal costs. We show that there is a first mover advantage for the leader in terms of quantity produced. This is the case for both types of cost functions.
